<p>Here are a few problems students have encountered in the past. Test your website on the instructional machines early!</p>
<ul>
<li>Your main report page should be called index.html.</li>
<li>Be sure to include and turn in all of the other files (such as images) that are linked in your report!</li>
<li>Use only <em>relative</em> paths to files, such as <pre>"./images/image.jpg"</pre>
Do <em>NOT</em> use absolute paths, such as <pre>"/Users/student/Desktop/image.jpg"</pre></li>
<li>Pay close attention to your filename extensions. Remember that on UNIX systems (such as the instructional machines), capitalization matters. <pre>.png != .jpeg != .jpg != .JPG</pre></li>
<li>Be sure to adjust the permissions on your files so that they are world readable. For more information on this please see this tutorial: <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html</a></li>

<!-- Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.

<h3>
  Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
</h3>
<p>
  To generate a ray we are given (x, y) in image space to pass through from the camera origin. Image space is bounded from (0, 0) to (1, 1) with (0.5, 0.5) at the center so to convert it to camera space we must first offset x and y by -0.5 so that the plane is centered at (0, 0). The plane is now bounded by (-0.5, -0,5) and (0.5, 0.5) so we multiply by 2 in order to have it bounded from (-1, -1) to (1, 1). We then multiply by tan(0.5 * radians(hFov)) to finish the transition to camera space. To convert from camera space we multiply by camera to world rotation matrix, c2w. Finally we generate our new ray with this normalized vector as the direction, the origin at pos, and min_t and max_t as nclip and fclip.
</p>
<p>In raytrace_pixel, we take ns_aa samples of the pixel and generate rays and trace them to get a Monte Carlo estimate of the pixel. We loop over the number of samples, choosing the position of the sample in the pixel from gridSampler->get_sample() and generating a ray for this position. We average the est_radiance_global_illumination of these sampled rays and update the pixel on the sample buffer.</p>

<h3>
  Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
</h3>
<img src="images/mollertrumbore.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
<p>
  The triangle can be represented in barycentric coordinates as a(P0) + b(P1) + g(P2) = (1-b-g)(P0) + b(P1) + g(P2). To find the intersection we can set this equal to the equation for a ray, O + tD, and rearranging results in the matrix system of equations shown in the image. Plugging in the values, we can determine t and the barycentric coordinates for the intersection. If the barycentric coordinates are all valid, between 0 and 1, and the t is between the min_t and max_t of the ray, then we determine that there is an intersection.

<h3>
  Walk through your BVH construction algorithm. Explain the heuristic you chose for picking the splitting point.
</h3>
<p>
  To construct our BVH we first loop over the primitives and enlarge the bounding box by the bounding box of each primitive, while also collecting some useful numbers to determine our heuristic with, the minimum and maximum centroids across the x, y, and z axes and the average of the centroids. Our heuristic is to pick the axis with the largest range and use the centroid of this axis as the splitting point for our left and right nodes. The idea is that the axis with the largest range will likely contain the most primitives spread out across it and taking the average splits them evenly. We calculate the range from the minimums and maximums and depending on the axis we choose we split the primitives using std::partition based on the .x, .y, or .z of the overall average centroid. We then recursively build the BVH by assigning the left and right nodes of the node to recursive calls on the partitioned halves of the primitives vector. The base case is if there are less than max_leaf_size primitives, then the node is a leaf and the left and right nodes are null.

<h3>
  Compare rendering times on a few scenes with moderately complex geometries with and without BVH acceleration. Present your results in a one-paragraph analysis.
</h3>
<p>
  Rendering cow.dae without BVH acceleration took 54.1692s with average 729.208034 intersection tests per ray. With BVH acceleration it took only 0.0749s with 2.131698 intersection tests per ray. Beetle.dae took 82.2256s with 1025.578253 intersection tests per ray vs 0.0721s with 1.311082 intersection tests per ray. Bench.dae took 953.2370s with 10727.354107 intersection tests per ray vs 0.0631s with 0.448200 intersection tests per ray. BVH acceleration greatly speeds up the process of rendering by allowing us to ignore rays that do not intersect the bounding boxes instead of checking every primitive individually. Our heuristic allows us to efficiently group the primitives in bounding boxes such that we can try to ignore as many primitives as possible per ray. The performance gains are more and more apparent with more complex geometries, which took more intersection tests more ray without BVH acceleration, allowing us to render some files that were not possible before.

<!-- Walk through both implementations of the direct lighting function.

<h3>
  Walk through both implementations of the direct lighting function.
</h3>
<p>
  For direct lighting with hemisphere sampling we used the Monte Carlo estimator from Lecture 13:
  <img src="images/3.3eq.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
  We loop over num_samples samples and for each sample we sample a ray direction, <code>wj</code>, from hemisphereSampler. We use this to generate a ray from <code>hit_p</code> in the direction <code>wj</code>. Because <code>wj</code> is sampled in object space, we must convert it to world space by multiplying by the object to world matrix, <code>o2w</code> and normalize. We set the <code>min_t</code> of this new ray to <code>EPS_F</code>, a small constant that prevents numerical precision issues where the ray intersects the surface it starts from. In order to check if the new ray adds direct illumination to the light source we use <code>bvh->intersect</code>. If it does intersect, we can add this sample to our running total. We multiply <code>fr</code>, the BSDF by <code>li</code>, the incoming light calculated from <code>get_emission()</code> of the intersection and then multiply by <code>cos_theta(wj)</code> and then normalize by dividing by the probability of this sample, <code>p(wj)</code>, which is the pdf of the hemisphere, <code>1/2PI</code>. Finally, we normalize the total by dividing by the number of samples.
