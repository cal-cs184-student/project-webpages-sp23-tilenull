<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, we implemented a cloth simulator based on a mass and spring system, featuring simulated movement via numerical integration, handling for collisions between objects as well as with itself, and finally, various shaders. We also learned a lot about shearing vs structural vs bending constraints, how ks, density, and damping affect the motion of cloth, as well as optimizations such as using a hashmap to track self-collisions and shaders to speed up rendering.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
<p>
	In this part, we implemented a system of point masses and springs for the cloth in Cloth::buildGrid. First, we constructed the grid of point masses. We did this by looping over num_width_points and num_height_points and converting these indices to the actual positions x and y by multiplying by width / num_width_points and height / num_height_points. If the cloth is horizontal we set the position of the mass to (x, 1, y) and if it is vertical, (x, y, z), where z is some random offset between -1/1000 and 1/1000. If the index is in the pinned vector, we set the mass’s pinned to true. We add each point mass to the point_masses vector, making sure to add them in row-major order by looping over the y indices in the outer loop and the x indices in the inner loop. Next, we create the springs between the point masses. We looped through indices of the masses in point_masses and since they are inserted in row-major order we are able to calculate their corresponding indices in the point mass grid with width1 = (width * (num_width_points)), y = i / width1, x = i - y * width1. Structural springs are with the masses to the left and above so we check that x > 0 and y > 0 respectively. Shearing springs are with the masses to the diagonal upper left and the diagonal upper right so we check that x < width1 - 1 && y > 0 and y > 0 && x > 0. Bending springs are with the masses two to the left and two above so we check that x >= 2 and y >= 2.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
  <p>
	In 2.1, we compute the total force acting on each point mass. First, we calculate the total external force F=ma by looping over external_accelerations, multiplying by mass, and adding it up. We then loop over the point masses and initialize the force on each to the total external force. Next, we add the spring correction forces by looping over the springs and using Hooke’s law Fs = ks * (||pa - pb|| - l). For each spring type, we check if it is enabled from cp->enable_structural_constraints. Since Fs is a scalar, we create a force vector with magnitude Fs and opposite directions from pa to pb or pb to pa and add them to the point mass a and b forces. Bending is weaker so we multiply by a small constant 0.2.
	</p>
	<p>In 2.2, we use Verlet Integration to compute the new point mass positions. If the point mass is not pinned, we calculate the new position using the formula</p>
	<img src="images/verlet.png" align="middle" width="350px"/>
	<p>where at is derived from the point mass’s forces divided by mass. We update last_position to the current position and position to the new calculated position.
	</p>
	<p>In 2.3, we constrain position updates so that a spring’s length does not pass 10% of its rest_length. If the distance between point mass a and point mass b is greater than 1.1 times the rest_length, then we apply the correction. The correction is a vector with direction from pm_a to pm_b or pm_b to pm_a with magnitude of the distance past 1.1 times the rest length. If neither are pinned, we apply the correction with half the magnitude to both point masses. If one is pinned then the correction is applied with the full magnitude to the unpinned point mass.
	</p>
	<p>
		With a small ks (ks=10) the cloth experienced more rippling and wrinkling. It took much longer to reach rest because small ripples on the edges persisted for a while. With a large ks (ks=100,000) the cloth experienced very little rippling. The area along the top where the cloth is pinned is much less curved and wrinkled, as is the rest of the cloth. This is because a larger spring constant results in stronger springs and a larger spring correction force via Hooke’s law so the springs will push the cloth back more towards its original state with larger ks.

		With a low density (density=1) the cloth is very even with little rippling while with a large density (density = 100), there is a lot of rippling as the cloth moves and wrinkles persist at rest. With a lower density the cloth is lighter and the springs have less resistance to push the cloth back to its original state while with a higher density there is more pull against the spring forces.

		With a low damping (damping=0), the cloth ripples and moves violently, swinging back and forth multiple times while with a high damping (damping=1), the cloth is very smooth and smoothly falls to rest. Low damping means more energy will be conserved so the cloth continues to move rapidly while the opposite happens as energy is dissipated with high damping.

<h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
  <p>
	In 3.1, we implemented handling for collisions with spheres. We can check if a point mass collides with a sphere since the intersection point will be at a distance of the radius from the center point of the sphere on the line from the center of the sphere to the position of the point mass. If the distance is less than the radius then there is a collision and we can calculate the intersection point likewise. We can then calculate the correction, which will have a magnitude of the distance from the point mass’s last position to the intersection point in the direction of the origin to the position, scaled by (1-friction). We apply this to the last position since it was the position before the collision and set the current position to the corrected position.	</p>
	<p>Shown below are images of scene/sphere.json with varying ks and Blinn-Phong shading. With smaller ks, the cloth is more flimsy and flexible, folding more and drooping further down on the sphere. With larger ks, the cloth is more rigid, folding down on the sphere less. This makes sense as a larger ks will cause the springs to hold the cloth’s original shape better.

	<p>In 3.2, we implemented handling for collisions with planes. We can check if a point mass collides with the plane by checking that the dot product of the last position and the plane normal is positive and the dot product of the current position and the plane normal is negative, indicating that it has passed to the other side of the plane. We calculate the intersection time in a similar fashion as in ray tracing, using the equation:</p>
	<img src="images/rayplaneintersect.png" align="middle" width="200px"/>
	<p>The correction vector thus has magnitude t and direction from the position after it crossed the plane to the last position, before it crossed the plane, scaled by (1 - friction). We apply it to the last position and push it slightly above the tangent point by applying another vector in the direction of the normal with magnitude SURFACE_OFFSET.
	</p>

	  <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
	  <p>
		In this part, we implement handling for self-collision. In Cloth::hash_position we compute a hash by mapping the position to a box by subtracting the fmod of the position and the box dimensions and then hash the coordinates by multiplying each by a random prime number and adding them together. We construct a map from hashes to point masses in the corresponding box, allowing us to look up point masses in the same box that might collide. Finally, we check for collisions for each point mass with the others in the box by checking that their distances are less than 2 * thickness. We also make sure to try to collide a point mass with itself by checking that the distance between the positions and last positions is greater than zero. If the masses collide, we create a correction vector with direction from one mass to the other and magnitude of how much closer than 2 * thickness they are. The final correction vector is the average of these correction vectors, divided by simulation_steps and applied to the point mass position.

			With low density (density=1), the cloth folds very smoothly over itself as it falls. In contrast, with high density (density=100), the cloth becomes very wrinkly with many folds in different directions as it falls.
